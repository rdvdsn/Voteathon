// accept user sign-up

        // team name and category

// insert users into some array of voters for distribution later
        // presumably may need to hold the entries they will have judged


// acquire the entry videos and the category they are entered in
        // can app handle this too?
        // users categorise their entry and upload video?
        // we need to then insert these into our structure


// form a "super-object" of these from which to form blocks to be pushed out to users
        // fairly simple array which will eventually hold...
        // title?, link, category, submitting user?, ranking
        
// submission deadline.

// randomly create blocks 
            // test block meets requirements to be pushed out


// push out to users their unique block to judge
            // can we build something that holds the 6 videos rather than 6 links users have to continually leave the app for???


// users will score each video
            // score necessary, can we only rank? 


// based on scores user is presented with an initial ranking to then refine
            // prompts like "You scored these the same, please state preference."
            // going to be annoying if all 6 get same rating


// finalised block ranking is received
            // user finalises their ranking in-app, this initiates the send back
            // could this free up a voter to vote again?
            // time constraints and participation going to be an issue here.


// depending on block size this is then used to generate N comparisons
            // easy processing here
            // don't know how to then imbed the python/matlab/whatever


// voting cut off
            // push the match-ups to some service which will generate rankings


// steal the ranking algorithm from network of comparisons



// take ranked output back and give a top 3 per category
